# Speed Lights for Skateboard

Arduino code for an MPU-6050, peizo sensor, and LED strip to visualize the speed and turning orientation of a skateboard.
As board turns, the inside of the turn turns green and the outside turns red.
As the board accelerates forward more light turn on and as the board decelerates less lights turn on.
When the board lands on a bump it send a pruple pulse down the board.
